NebulaMenu is a fully custom RGB‑powered mod menu for Among Us, built with a clean modular architecture and a cosmic visual identity. Designed for fast iteration and frictionless expansion, it delivers a draggable UI, animated RGB accents, toggle‑based features, and a flexible framework for adding movement mods, teleport tools, visual tweaks, and more. This project focuses on originality, performance, and a polished user experience without copying any existing menus or frameworks.
